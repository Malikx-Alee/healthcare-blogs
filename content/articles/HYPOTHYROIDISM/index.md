Thyroid is a bow-tie shaped gland located in the base of your neck. It releases hormones that regulate vital body functions from breathing to heart rate, body weight, menstrual cycle, body temperature and muscle strength.

### How the thyroid gland works?

Iodine consumed in the form of food is taken up by thyroid to make two main vital hormones; tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxin (T4). Thyroid gland works under the influence of pituitary gland from the brain through thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Lower levels of T3 and T4 stimulate the release of TSH which makes the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones and vice versa. Protein bound and free thyroxin (T4) or TSH levels in blood are markers for thyroid functioning.

### What are thyroid diseases?

Alterations in the normal thyroid hormone levels cause thyroid diseases. Either too much secretions (hyperthyroidism) or lesser secretions (hypothyroidism) is directly related with thyroid function and may be due to inflammation of thyroid (thyroiditis)

### What is hypothyroidism?

Hypothyroidism is “underactive thyroid gland” which cannot produce enough thyroid hormones to regulate body functions normally. People with primary hypothyroidism have higher levels of TSH but lower levels of free T4 in their blood.
Normal levels of TSH and Total T4 are 0.4 to 4 mIU/L and 5 to 12μg/dL. Higher TSH or lower T4 level than normal range indicates hypothyroidism. Sometimes patients may face subclinical hypothyroidism with normal thyroxin level but higher than normal TSH.

### What are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?

Hypothyroidism may cause:

- Dry skin and hairs
- Decreased heart rate
- Fatigue
- Joint pains & swelling
- Muscle aches, weakness and stiffness
- Elevated cold sensitivity, cholesterol, puffiness & body-weight
- Changes in menstrual cycle and difficulty in conceiving
- Constipation
- Depression

Children with hypothyroidism may face delay in growth and puberty along with the above symptoms. Mostly symptoms progress gradually over years as the thyroid keeps getting slow and slower.

### What is the most accurate test for hypothyroidism?

Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not visible on early stages of disease condition. However, it can certainly be diagnosed by your doctor at early stage with blood tests for TSH and T4. TSH test is important for disease management because it helps to find the right medicine regimen and drug dosage.

### How it can be treated?

Typically hypothyroidism, all over the world is treated with synthetic thyroid hormone (levo-thyroxin) taken orally. It regulates adequate hormone levels, preventing the signs and symptoms. These symptoms can only be prevented with life-long use of levo-thyroxin. However its dose can always be adjusted according to your disease stage and TSH levels in blood test any time. Once your dose is adjusted according to requirement you will gradually start feeling difference in your body functioning.

### How thyroxin dose is adjusted?

TSH is performed every 6 to 8 weeks to determine the initial right dosage of levo-thyroxine. After that, blood levels are generally checked six monthly, annually and depending on signs and symptoms or as prescribed by endocrinologist.

### Is it safe to take levothyroxin?

Levothyroxine apparently has no side effects when used in the appropriate dose. Excessive dose may cause:

- Heart palpitation
- Insomnia
- Shakiness
- Increased appetite

It is an inexpensive drug but if you are changing its brands, take your doctor in loop to ensure you are taking right amount of dose. Also, don't skip doses or stop taking the drug when you start feeling better because hypothyroidism’s treatment is life-long and symptoms can only be reversed with continuous use of drug only.

### Why thyroxin is needed to take on empty stomach?

Levothyroxin is best taken on an empty stomach at the same time every day either early in the morning at least an hour before breakfast or minimum four hours after last meal. Its absorption is affected with:

- Large amount of Soy products
- High fiber diet
- Calcium & iron supplements or multivitamins containing them
- Antacids with aluminum hydroxide
