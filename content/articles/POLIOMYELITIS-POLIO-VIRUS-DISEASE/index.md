Polio, or poliomyelitis, is an impeding and potentially fatal viral infection caused by the poliovirus that strikes the human nervous system effecting brain and spinal cord virtually paralyzing the body or some part of it.

### How Polio is transmitted?

The virus is highly contagious and spreads from person to person through contaminated food, water, contact with droplets from sneeze and cough or feces from infected person. It only affects humans; children under 5 years of age are most susceptible. It enters the body through oral route and spreads through. An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and up to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.

### Is polio curable?

Polio is non-curable and even children who seem fully recovered can develop new physical symptoms like muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis, 15 to 40 years later. This is called post-polio symptom or late effects of polio.

### How can I find its symptoms?

Its symptoms are not very visible. Only 28 out of 100 affected people show symptoms out of which only 1 to 4 patients show most common symptoms of flu, accompanied by sore throat, fever, lethargy, headache, nausea, vomiting and stomach pain. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days, then go away on their own.

Only a few people with poliovirus infection will develop more serious symptoms that affect the brain and spinal cord: paresthesia (abnormal feeling like pricking and burning in limbs), meningitis (infection of the meninges-covering of the spinal cord and brain) paralysis (numbness or immobility of body; partially or completely) and weakness of limbs, occurs in just 1 out of 200 polio infected people and meningitis occurs in only 1 out of 25 polio infected people. Paralysis is the most drastic symptom associated with polio, because it leads to permanent disability and mortality. 5-10 % deaths are commonly due to the paralysis of respiratory muscles that help them breathe.

### How we can defeat polio?

Polio vaccination is the only way to stop the disease from spreading and to protect children. Vaccines should be administered at the age of 2 months, 4 months and 6 through 18 months. Than a booster dose at the age of 4 and 6 years are given.

### Do I need to get vaccinated as an adult?

Adults have already got vaccinated as children but a few groups of adults are always at higher risk for example anyone traveling to polio-endemic or high-risk areas of the world, healthcare worker serving infected patients and laboratory workers that are handling suspected or contaminated specimens and should be vaccinated in the following situations. Adults who are at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus and have previously completed all courses of polio vaccine can receive one lifetime booster dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Adults who have never been vaccinated against polio should get 3 doses of IPV by zero time, 1 to 2 months later and third dose 6 to 12 months after the second.

### Who are polio endemic countries?

South East Asia, Western Pacific, America and Europe are declared as polio free regions of the world. However, Afghanistan and Pakistan are on the list of Polio endemic countries.

### Polio eradication in Pakistan

Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme has reduced the cases massively declining by 99 % since 1994 from 20â€™000 cases to 12 cases annually till 2018. However polio cases count has again risen as 147 confirmed cases in 2019 and 81 cases this year till date. Not a single Pakistani child is safe from polio if the virus is circulating in Pakistani populations. Therefore it is our combined responsibility to ensure vaccination for this deadly disease to each individual under the vulnerable age.

Have you administered two drops to your children?
