### What is hypertension?

It is the persistently elevated arterial blood pressure. Normally blood pressure exceeding 130mmHg and 80mmHg is considered hypertensive. It has four types according to systolic (heart contracting) and diastolic (heart relaxing) blood pressures (BP) namely normal BP [<120/<80mmHg], elevated BP (pre-hypertension) [<130/<80 mmHg], stage I hypertension [<140/<90mmHg] and stage II hypertension [>140/>90mmHg]. The chronic hypertension may leads to heart diseases, kidney damage, brain injury and many other vascular diseases.

### What is hypertension?

More than 90% patients have unidentifiable cause of hypertension. Other known causes are diabetes, obesity, stressful lifestyle, smoking and increased dietary intake of sodium.

### How it can be treated?

Major groups of medicines used to treat hypertension lower the arterial blood pressure each in its different way. Each group has its own side effects. These major medication regimens are diuretics, β-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-II inhibitors (ARB), α-blockers and renin inhibitors

### What are common side effects of antihypertensive drugs?

1. **Diuretics:**

Diuretics decreases BP by increasing excretion of sodium and water, thus decrease the blood volume. Commonly used diuretics are thiazide-diuretics, loop-diuretics and sometimes potassium-sparing-diuretics (to reduce side-effects).

Possible side-effects of diuretics include electrolyte imbalances and low blood pressure (hypotension), these may result in muscle cramps, weakness, dizziness, skin sensitivity & rashes, vomiting & diarrhea and sometimes constipation. Diuretics can make diabetes, kidney issues, gout, and other water related problems worse.

1. **Beta Blockers:**

Beta blockers work by decreasing cardiac output and relaxing blood vessels and decreasing salt re-absorption in kidneys. These are used for patients having hypertension along with other heart diseases. Some side-effects of beta-blockers may include hypotension, decreased heart rate, dryness of mouth and skin, lack of sleep, weakness, fatigue and cold hands & feet. The β-blockers may decrease libido and cause erectile dysfunction. Beta-blockers should be given with caution in patients with diabetes, asthma, or inflammatory lung diseases and kidney diseases.

3. **ACE Inhibitors:**

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activates angiotensin-II; the most powerful natural vasoconstrictor. By blocking this enzyme, blood vessels are relaxed and BP lowers down. Most common side-effect is dry cough. Other less common effects are alteration in taste & appetite, skin rash, swelling of skin; generally around lips and throat or whole body and reversible kidney failure in susceptible cases.

Patients with diabetes, heart diseases, kidney defects and allergies should not take ACE inhibitors. It is strictly prohibited in pregnancy due to developmental defects in babies.

Similar side-effects are seen with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and renin inhibitors.

4. **Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB):**

Calcium helps in muscle contractions so by blocking calcium channels, heart muscles and smooth muscles of arterioles are relaxed which decrease cardiac output and blood flow; resultantly the blood pressure. Side-effects of CCB are flushing, tiredness, dizziness, headache, hypotension and swollen feet or ankles. These should be used with caution in patients with heart diseases or diabetes.

5. **Alpha Receptor Blockers:**

They act by relaxing blood vessels and allow the blood to flow freely thus lowering the BP. Due to the use of alpha-blockers there is rapid increase in heart rate and postural hypotension (sudden drop of BP while standing up).

### How can you monitor your side-effects?

Patients and their clinicians can monitor the probable side-effects and adjust treatment accordingly. Followings steps can be taken:

- Tell your doctor your complete medication history to avoid any kind of drug-drug interaction and severe adverse effects of any medicine in use.
- Always take medicines as prescribed for the required period and on specified time
- Regularly self-inspect yourself
- Monitor your BP daily and make a chart
- Check your heartbeat regularly
- Note any dizziness, headache or sense of unrests especially on standing-up
- Observe your body for any rashes or physical change
- Analyze all these symptoms to find any possible side-effect
- In case of any adverse feeling immediately contact to your doctor or nearest hospital
