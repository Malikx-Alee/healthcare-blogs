Acute respiratory disorder caused by influenza viruses (A, B, and C) is commonly called seasonal flu or influenza. It attacks your respiratory system including your nose, throat and lungs. Flu Shots are high in demand on the start of fall season every year to protect yourself and others from its ambush. It can make your life a little easier.

### If You Catch the Flu, Do You Know What to Do?

You can simply protect yourself from this serious virus with just an immediate prick of needle or mist of nasal spray. It cannot be considered as a simple common cold. The following symptoms are familiar in common cold and seasonal flu but more severe in case of flu:

- Cough
- Sore throat
- Chills
- Fatigue
- Body aches
- High fever
- Runny or stuffed nose accompanied by headache
- Sometimes children also experience vomiting and diarrhea

The flu can grab you by surprise with all of its severity and leave you feel ill for longer period. Every flu season is different, and influenza virus affects people differently depending on certain factors. So, flu vaccines are prepared taking in consideration all those factors. They are made to target three or four types of flu viruses responsible for spread upcoming year.

### How it works?

Flu shots are responsible to make active antibodies in the body. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for their development. Vaccines contain those weak viruses that are responsible for infection in the form of antigens but cannot cause infection. These in turn produce antibodies in the body that can kill these viruses.

### When should you get it?

Most likely flu season hits in November or December, but it actually begins as early as October and stays as late as May. So it’s better to get yourself and your family vaccinated as soon as season’s vaccine arrives.

### Who should get it?

- Children, especially from 6 months to 5 years old
- Pregnant women
- Adults age 65 and older
- People with chronic health conditions
- Those who live in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities
- Certain groups of people, including Native Americans and Alaska Natives
- Travelers and people living abroad

### Who should avoid it?

The following people shouldn’t get a flu vaccine:

- Children under 6 months old
- People who are very allergic to the flu shot or any of its ingredients

### Is there possibility to get seasonal flu even if i got vaccinated this year?

There is slight possibility of getting sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated. However, studies tell that vaccine reduces the severity of illness. This is possible for the following reasons:

- You may got exposed to the virus just before getting vaccinated
- You may be exposed to the type of virus that is not included in flu vaccine.

### Flu and COVID-19

There is no research evidence that getting a flu vaccine increases your risk of getting ill from a coronavirus. Also getting flu shot cannot protect you from Corona virus.

### Is flu vaccine beneficial in other ways?

- In recent times flu vaccination has become an important defensive tool for people with chronic health conditions.
- Flu vaccination helps protect pregnant women and lactating mothers.
- Flu vaccination on time reduces the risk of flu-associated hospitalization.
- Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people you love and care about, including those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness like babies and elderly.

Late protection is better than no protection. All you need to do is set up an appointment time that works for you.
