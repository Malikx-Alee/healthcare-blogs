Smog is a yellowish or brownish grey haze formed mainly by the reaction of water droplets with heavy and light pollutants in the atmosphere. It is characterized by an unpleasant odour due to its gaseous components and a dense misty air that makes you feel suffocated or choked and affects your range of vision bringing it to less or zero visibility.

### Smog is same all around?

Smog is categorized as summer smog or more common winter smog chemically called oxidizing or reducing smog. Summer smog (oxidizing smog) is due to photo transformation of ozone and other hydrocarbon combustion products, thus called photochemical smog. An overall result of oxidizing smog is the formation of powerful oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and ozone in the air.

During the winter months when the temperature drops, consumption of coal and other fossil fuel for heating and burning increases. These combustion effusions create winter smog (reducing smog). It contains high contents of sulfurdioxide which is very toxic to life.

### How we are affected from smog?

Smog is detrimental and effects all including humans, plants, animals and even buildings. Respiratory tract allergies are triggered by smog cause coughing, wheezing and wet eyes. It aggravates asthma and may lead to asthma attack. Lung diseases that occur due to smog include bronchitis, pneumonia and emphysema. Sore-eyes is one of the most common effect of smog which further leads to eye infections. Heavy smog hinders direct sunlight which may cause impaired metabolism and Vitamin-D deficiency leading to rickets.

### How we can reduce it?

Smog is a significant problem in winters. But, everyone can do their part to reduce smog by changing a few behaviors, such as:

- Plant more trees and ban tree cutting.
-     For industries, use renewable and eco-friendly energy resources.
-     Drive less and use public transport, bicycle more. Walk is another healthy option as well.
-     Use environment friendly products more in daily routine like paints, paper, plastics, sprays etc.
-     Pay attention to your cars. Regular oil changing and tune-ups, and inflating tires to the proper level can improve gas mileage and reduce emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons.
-     Get your cars fueled up during the cooler hours of the day or early morning to prevent gas fumes from boiling up and producing ozone.
-     Avoid gas-powered equipment, like gas irons. Use electric appliances instead

### RISING SMOG PROBLEM IN PAKISTAN:

Air quality is measured in air quality index (AQI) as 0 to 500 with safe to moderate range from 50 to 100 AQI. It is the average of six pollutants concentrations: carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter (PM) in the air which is measured in PM2.5 and PM10 as per criteria from WHO. PM2.5 up to 35 μg/m3 is considered safe.
Pakistan is ranked as the 2nd most polluted out of 98 countries in the world with 156 US AQI and an annual PM2.5 average of 65.81 μg/m3 in 2019. Lahore; the capital of Punjab Province, is ranked 2nd in the world in Air Visual’s world air quality report (IQ Air) with an AQI of 271, while air pollution in Pakistan’s capital city Islamabad showed significantly low value. Karachi’s index was the lowest securing last number in the country. Currently Raiwind is considered the most polluted city in Pakistan with US AQI as 423.

### After Math:

With every passing day almost all cities of Pakistan are showing signs of worsening air quality. According to WHO more than 22,000 people die because of smog and outdoor pollutants every year in Pakistan.
It’s a high time for every Pakistani to be the solution to run off the pollution. Wake up and smell the smog this winter. Be the part of Anti-pollution revolution and clean your air before it pollutes you.
