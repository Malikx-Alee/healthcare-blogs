WHO is having The eighth International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week (ILPPW) between 25-31 Oct 2020. This week of acton is an initative of the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (the Lead Pain Alliance) which is jointly led by the UN Environment Programme and WHO. The manufacture and sale of lead paint is still permitted in over 60% of countries, presenting a continuing and future source of lead exposure for children and workers.

### Impact of Lead

Lead is a toxic metal that causes adverse effects on both human health and the environment. While lead exposure is also harmful to adults, lead exposure harms children at much lower levels, and the health effects are generally irreversible and can have a lifelong impact.

The younger the child, the more harmful lead can be, and children with nutritional deficiencies absorb ingested lead at an increased rate. The human fetus is the most vulnerable, and a pregnant woman can transfer lead that has accumulated in her body to her developing child. Lead is also transferred through breast milk when lead is present in a nursing mother.
Evidence of reduced intelligence caused by childhood exposure to lead has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to list “lead-caused mental retardation” as a recognized disease. WHO also lists it as one of the top ten diseases whose health burden among children is due to modifiable environmental factors.

Children are exposed to lead from paint when lead-containing paint on walls, windows, doors or other painted surfaces begins to chip or deteriorate, since this causes lead to be released to dust and soil. When a surface previously painted with lead paint is sanded or scraped in preparation for repainting, very large amounts of lead-contaminated dust is produced, which can constitute a severe health hazard.

Once lead enters a child’s body through ingestion, inhalation, or across the placenta, it has the potential to damage several biological systems and pathways. The primary target is the central nervous system and the brain, but lead can also affect the blood system, the kidneys, and the skeleton.[6] Lead is also categorized as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC).
It is generally agreed that one key element in lead toxicity is its capacity to replace calcium in neurotransmitter systems, proteins, and bone structure, altering function and structure and thereby leading to severe health impacts. Lead is also known to affect and damage cell structure.

### International Study on Lead Contents in Paints

In 2017, there was a study report conducted by International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) in Pakistan to collect the data on the total lead content of solvent-based paints for home use available on the market in Pakistan. They found that 17 out of 21 analyzed brands (81 percent of paint brands) sold at least one lead paint, i.e. a paint with lead concentration above 90 ppm. 14 out of 21 analyzed brands (67 percent of paint brands) sold at least one lead paint with dangerously high lead concentrations above 10,000 ppm.

This study demonstrates that solvent-based paints for home use with high concentrations of lead are widely available in Pakistan since the paints included in this study are brands commonly sold in retail stores all over Pakistan. The results are a cause of concern in terms of health and well-being of the people of Pakistan, particularly children who are most at risk. However, the fact that 23 out of 58 paints (40 percent of paints) contained lead concentrations below 90 ppm indicates that the technology to produce paints without added lead exists in Pakistan. The study results provide a strong justification to adopt and enforce a regulation that will ban the manufacture, import, export, distribution, sale and use of paints with total lead concentrations greater than 90 ppm.

### Recommendations:

- Pakistan Standards & Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) to immediately take steps to ban the manufacture, import, export, distribution, sale, and use of lead paints

- Government deparments federal & provincial needs to work closely with PSQCA to overcome the challenges by introducing necessary legislation and then enforcement of law

- Paint companies needed to come forward to move to non lead based paints

- Awareness needed to create among the consumers so they can ask non lead based paints only
