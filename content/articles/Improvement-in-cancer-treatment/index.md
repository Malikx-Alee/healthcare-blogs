### What is cancer?

Cancer is when body cells start to divide abnormally resulting in tumors and infiltration of a tissue in other parts of the body. Cancerous cells use most of the important nutrients of the body which becomes weaker day by day due to lessened body maintenance, ultimately lead to death.

### How cancer can be treated?

Conventional ways of treating cancer are to remove the tumors physically by surgery or radiotherapy, followed by sessions of cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy) to completely eradicate cancerous cells from the body. But these methods have a lot of side effects that significantly alter the life quality of the patient.
From last decade, cancer death-rate has declined persistently. Researchers all around the globe have achieved major advances regarding prevention, diagnose, treatment, complexities and survival against cancer. Exciting improvements are making their ways towards treatments and possibilities.

### What are improvements in cancer therapy?

In today’s medical world, cancer therapy shows tremendous improvements to palliate cancer. Modern treatments now days are:

- Immunotherapy
- Immune checkpoint inhibitors
- Monoclonal antibodies
- Biological Response modulators
- Gene based treatments
- Cancer vaccines

### Immunotherapy:

Immunotherapy is the latest and most accepted improvement in cancer treatment due to its marked outcomes in cancer management. Immune system hunts and kills disease causing agents like microbes, damaged and abnormal cells e.g. cancer cells in the body. Moto of immunotherapy is to make your immune system strong enough to fight against cancer cells. Immunotherapy is a broad treatment strategy including various therapeutic ways:

### Immune checkpoint inhibitors

Immune checkpoints are markers that differentiate normal cells from cancerous cells which sometimes use these checkpoints to hide their identity from the normal cells. Inhibitors of these immune checkpoints prevent cancerous cells from “hiding” from the immune system.

### Monoclonal antibodies:

Antibodies are proteins that attach themselves with other proteins (antigens) on the surface of abnormal cell and can restore or engage disease-fighting molecules hence triggering cell destruction. Synthetic antibodies that can attach a single type of antigen are called monoclonal antibodies and can be used to target cancerous cells with least side effects. These, when used in combination with chemotherapy have resulted in remarkably extended survival and least disease progression for patients on chemotherapy alone.

### Immune modulating agents:

Immune modulators stimulate production and activates normal immune cells hence boost the immune response of the body. These include cytokines, BCG and immunomodulatory drugs. Cytokines are proteins of white blood cells (WBCs) that fight infection and cancer in body. Interleukins and interferons are cytokines that can be used in cancer treatment. Interleukins (ILs) stimulate the growth of killer WBC; T & B lymphocytes that engulf the foreign particles and cancerous cells. Interferons (INFs) activates certain WBCs; that kill cancerous cell, and forbid the growth and promote their death. BCG are weakened bacteria used to treat bladder cancer and are example of cancer vaccine as well. Immunomodulatory drugs stimulate the immune system.

### Gene-Based Treatments

Every detail of one’s biomolecules is written in the genes, unique for every individual. Root-cause of every cancer is mutations in genes that give clues about how every individual’s cancer can act and how precisely best treatment be used. This customized gene based treatment for every individual is known as precision medication which is most likely to successfully treat an individual’s cancer, based on the detailed genetic map of that person’s specific cancer.

Along with colorectal and breast cancer treatment; precision medication is greatly under consideration for treatment of certain types of leukemia and lymphomas. However it is expensive and underdeveloped technique and many treatment designs are in clinical trial phase.

### Cancer vaccines

Cancer vaccines make immune system, recognize and eliminate cancer cells and can be made from cancer cells already existing in one’s body. These vaccines are preventive, therapeutic and personalized neo-antigen vaccines, depending on specifications.
