According to WHO, there are 11 companies doing Phase 3 trial of Covid19 Vaccination. Phase 3 is the last stage of trial before getting approval and in this phase vaccination is given to thousands of volunteers to monitor immunogenecity and any serious adverse effects. 
Result of the Phase 3 trial determines one of the key factor for approval which is Vaccine Efficacy (VE). It is the percentage reduction of cases with vaccination. For last couple of weeks, we have heard great news of vaccine efficacy around 95%. How big is this number, we can estimate is by knowning the efficacy of vaccines for other diseases e.g. for BCG its under 80%. Question is if companies have achieved such a high figure then why its still not approved by FDA. Reason is apart from efficiency, it must be ensured that its meeting high bar of safety and companies have to provide ample amount of data to prove this.
