DeepMind which is UK based subdivision of Alphabet (Google) published its study in nature about its gigantic breakthrough for determining a protein's 3D shape from its amino-acids sequence.

DeepMind's program, called AlphaFold uses large genomic datasets to predict protein structure. The generated 3D protein structure are far more accurate than any that have come before.

Almost every function of our body including transportation and storage of nutrients, growth and maintenace of tissues, digestion, blood clotting, muscle contract etc. relies on proteins. Function of protein depends on its unique 3D structure. The recipes of those proteins are encoded in our DNA. Any error in the recipe may result in a malformed protein resulting in disease or death. 

In order to understand the problem, its important to visualize and study the 3D structure of protein but this structure can not be determines by knowing the recipe. Proteins are comprised of chains of amino acids. DNA only contains information about the sequence of these amino acids not about how they fold into shape. 

Over the past, researchers have been able to determine shapes of proteins in labs using experimental techniques whihc depend on a lot of trial and error. To catalyse research and measure progress, a biennial global competition called CASP (Clinical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) was established in 1994. DeepMind's work which submitted to CASP13 have claimed unprecedented progress in the ability of computational methods to predict protein sructure using neural networks.

Their work is open source and avaiable at github (code repository) [Source Code](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/alphafold_casp13)
