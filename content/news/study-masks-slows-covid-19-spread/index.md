According to a recent study, wearing a mask can slow down the spread of this deadly virus.  Places with mandatory mask showed a reduction in the covid-19 cases over a period of time whereas the rest had increasing cases on a daily basis. 

It has become the talk of the town to wear a mask. Every shop and every place had displayed poster of “No entry Without Mask”. Still people are reluctant to wear mask. Especially in Pakistan, wearing a mask is an act to be joked about. Still A lot of people does not take it seriously.

Wearing a mask is “incredibly frustrating” for some of the people while on the contrary it should have been seen as a wise and sensible decision to save not only yourself but your country as well.
