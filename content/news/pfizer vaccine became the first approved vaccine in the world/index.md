UK became the first country in the world which approved coronavirus Pfizer vaccine for widespread use. Vaccine prepared by Pfizer / BioNTech offers 95% protection against Covid-19 illness. UK has ordered 40m doses out of which 10m doese should be available soon, with the first 0.8M arriving in the coming days.

## How it Works

Vaccine is based on mRNA that uses a tiny fragment of the genetic code from the virus which is applied through injection. On entering the cells, it tells them to produce coronavirus spike protein resulting in production of antibodies and activation of T-Cells. These antibodies and T-Cells not only destory the infected cells bu also become the safeguard against new viruse attacks.

## Who will receive it first

In the first phase, top prirority will be given to old people and staff dealing with patients. It will be given in two doses with difference of 21 days. Secon dose will act as booster.

## Vaccination in Pakistan

Last week, Chughtai Lab signed a MOU with Pfizer to setup vaccination centers which will imrpove access to vaccines across the country. There are various challenges involved specially to store the vaccine at -70C and need to be trasnferred in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept in fridge upto five days. Inernational price of vaccine per dose is around 20USD which converts to 3200 PKR resulting in total cost of 6400 PKR per person. However after adding other expenses like transporation, service fees, etc. there is expectation that it will be in around three times the base price resuling in around 18,000 PKR per person
