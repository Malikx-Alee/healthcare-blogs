There has been a new global analysis assessing the height and weight of school-aged children and adolescents all around the world. According to the study, the height and weight which are the indicators of their health and their quality of diet may vary immensely.

The research included the data spanning from 1985 to 2019. It reveals that over the years, as the economy of China grew, there was a 8 cm difference in the tallest boy of 19 year old. Those nations with the shortest 19-year-olds in 2019 were mostly in south and southeast Asia, Latin America and East Africa, including Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, Guatemala and Bangladesh.  Global height ranking for UK has worsened over past 35 years, with 19-year-old falling from 28th tallest in 1985 (176.3 cm) to 39th in 2019 (178.2 cm).

The author of this study suggests that it should motivate policies to increase the availability and reduce the cost of nutritious foods, as this will help children grow taller without gaining excessive weight for their height. The initiatives include food vouchers towards nutritious foods for low-income families, and free healthy school meal programs which are particularly under threat during the pandemic.
