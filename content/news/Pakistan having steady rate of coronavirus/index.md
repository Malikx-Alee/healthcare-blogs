Pakistan having steady rate of coronavirus postive cases

For last 2.5 months, Pakistan is having 600 coronavirus cases per day on the average while conducting around 28,000+ cases daily. It accounts for roughly 2% of Tests to cases ratio.
Although many people believe that this number will be higher than reported number because large number of people are not going for tests any more. However, in general its good balance as its almost impossible to make it 0% where public is not ready to follow SOPs in the same way as followed in developed countries.
