Multinational US Pharmaceutical company Pfizer and Germany biotechnology company BioNTech announced that effectiveness of their vaccination against corona is above 90% in first analysis. Pfizer which is famous for many common drug products like Ansaid, Ponstan announced on 9th November "I would say itâ€™s a historical moment. Something like this has never happened before". They tried vaccination on 435,000 people in 6 different countries and didn't find any major complaint.

These companies are interested to get permission to produce vaccination on emergency basis to release it by end of November. They are confident to produce around 50 million doses by end of 2020. Vaccination needed in two doses with a gap of three weeks.

Announcement created a huge hope throughout the world, however on the other side experts are showing reservations as detailed testing data not released yet e.g. what type of pepole it was tested, what was their medical condition etc. At the same time, it also has worrying part for poor countries where health standards are not followed as per international guidelines. One of the biggest concern is its transportation as it needed to be kept highly low temperature of -80 degree Celsius. Will Pakistan be able to cope with it?
Lets be optimistic and hope to get answers of these concerns soon.
